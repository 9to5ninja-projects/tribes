# Ecological Food Web Analysis
## Trophic Structure & Energy Flow

### TROPHIC LEVELS (Bottom → Top)

#### Level 0: PRIMARY PRODUCERS (Not in game, but implied)
- Grasses, shrubs, aquatic plants, phytoplankton
- **Energy Base**: 100% (Solar → Chemical)

---

#### Level 1: PRIMARY CONSUMERS (Herbivores)
**Energy Available**: ~10% of producers
**Biomass Ratio**: HIGH (numerous, sustain higher trophic levels)

**TERRESTRIAL GRAZERS** (Open habitats)
- **Bison** (Grassland/Savanna) - Large, herd, high yield
- **Gazelle** (Savanna) - Medium, fast, herd
- **Deer** (Forest/Grassland) - Medium, browsing, moderate herd
- **Rabbit** (Grassland/Forest) - Small, prolific, low yield

**COLD-ADAPTED GRAZERS**
- **Caribou** (Taiga/Tundra) - Large, migratory herd
- **Musk Ox** (Tundra/Snow) - Large, defensive formation

**MEGAFAUNA**
- **Elephant** (Savanna/Rainforest) - Massive, mixed diet, low predation

**SPECIALIST HERBIVORES**
- **Iguana** (Desert/Beach) - Small, vegetarian, slow
- **Frog** (Rainforest/Swamp) - Tiny, insectivore (technically secondary consumer)

**ECOLOGICAL NOTES**:
- Herbivores should be **most common** in ecosystems
- Provide **most reliable food source** for humans and predators
- **Herd behavior** = predictable but requires coordination to hunt
- **Body size** correlates with meat yield but also danger/difficulty

---

#### Level 2: SECONDARY CONSUMERS (Small-Medium Predators)
**Energy Available**: ~10% of herbivores (1% of base)
**Biomass Ratio**: MEDIUM (less numerous than prey)

**PACK HUNTERS** (Social, coordinated)
- **Wolf** (Forest/Taiga) - Preys on: Deer, Caribou, Rabbit
- **Lion** (Savanna) - Preys on: Gazelle, Bison, (young Elephant)
- **Arctic Fox** (Tundra/Snow) - Preys on: Rabbit, (scavenges Caribou/Musk Ox)
- **Red Fox** (Grassland/Forest) - Preys on: Rabbit, (small prey)

**AMBUSH HUNTERS** (Solitary, stealth)
- **Leopard** (Rainforest/Savanna) - Preys on: Gazelle, Deer, smaller prey
- **Snow Leopard** (Mountain/Snow) - Preys on: Caribou, Musk Ox
- **Jackal** (Desert/Savanna) - Preys on: Rabbit, Gazelle (opportunistic scavenger)

**OMNIVORES** (Flexible diet = ecological advantage)
- **Bear** (Forest) - Preys on: Deer, Rabbit + berries, fish
- **Boar** (Forest/Rainforest) - Preys on: small animals + roots, fungi
- **Giant Toad** (Rainforest/Swamp) - Preys on: Frog, insects

**AQUATIC PREDATORS**
- **Crocodile** (Rivers/Swamp) - Preys on: anything at water's edge (ambush)
- **Predatory Fish** (Rivers/Lakes) - Preys on: smaller fish

**SPECIALIST PREDATORS**
- **Snake** (Rainforest/Desert) - Preys on: Rabbit, Frog, Iguana

**ECOLOGICAL NOTES**:
- Predators are **rarer** than herbivores (10:1 ratio realistic)
- **Hunting them = less meat, higher danger, but valuable pelts/parts**
- Pack hunters = more dangerous, require group tactics
- Omnivores = more resilient to prey scarcity

---

#### Level 3: APEX PREDATORS (Top of Food Chain)
**Energy Available**: ~10% of secondary (0.1% of base)
**Biomass Ratio**: LOW (very few, wide territories)

**TERRESTRIAL APEX**
- **Polar Bear** (Snow/Tundra) - Preys on: Seals (Marine Mammal), Caribou, Musk Ox
- **Lion** (Savanna) - Also apex (dual role)

**AQUATIC APEX**
- **Shark** (Ocean/Coastal) - Preys on: Fish, Marine Mammals
- **Marine Mammal** (Ocean) - Orca/Seal (Shark preys on these, but they also hunt)

**AERIAL APEX**
- **Raptor** (Generalist) - Preys on: Rabbit, Songbirds, small prey

**ECOLOGICAL NOTES**:
- **Extremely rare** in nature (1% of total fauna)
- **High danger, low meat yield per encounter**
- Valuable for **prestige materials** (teeth, claws, feathers)
- Hunting these should be **high-risk, ceremonial events**

---

#### Level 4: DECOMPOSERS & SCAVENGERS (Closes the loop)
**Energy Available**: Recycles all trophic waste
**Ecological Role**: CRITICAL (prevent disease, nutrient cycling)

**CARRION SPECIALISTS**
- **Scavenger** (Vulture/Hyena archetype) - Feeds on: all dead animals
- **Arctic Fox** (secondary role when prey scarce)
- **Jackal** (secondary role, opportunistic)

**ECOLOGICAL NOTES**:
- Should be **common wherever predation occurs**
- Presence of scavengers = healthy ecosystem indicator
- Game mechanic: **Failed hunts attract scavengers**
- Can become **disease vectors** if overpopulated

## PREDATOR-PREY MATRIX

### WHO EATS WHOM (Organized by Predator)

| Predator | Primary Prey | Secondary Prey | Competes With |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Wolf** | Deer, Caribou | Rabbit | Bear, Snow Leopard |
| **Lion** | Gazelle, Bison | Young Elephant | Leopard, Jackal |
| **Bear** | Deer, Fish | Rabbit, Berries | Wolf |
| **Polar Bear** | Marine Mammal, Caribou | Musk Ox | Arctic Fox |

| **Arctic Fox** | Rabbit | Carrion (scavenge) | Polar Bear |
| **Red Fox** | Rabbit | Frog, Insects | Snake |
| **Boar** | Roots, Fungi | Small animals | Bear |
| **Jackal** | Rabbit, Gazelle | Carrion | Lion, Leopard |
| **Crocodile** | Any water's edge | Fish | None (ambush specialist) |

## BIOMASS PYRAMID (Population Ratios)

For a **balanced ecosystem**, approximate population ratios:

```
APEX PREDATORS:        1    (Shark, Polar Bear)
SECONDARY PREDATORS:   10   (Wolf, Lion, Leopard, etc.)
PRIMARY PREDATORS:     50   (Fox, Snake, smaller hunters)
OMNIVORES:             30   (Bear, Boar - buffer species)
LARGE HERBIVORES:      200  (Bison, Elephant, Caribou)
MEDIUM HERBIVORES:     500  (Deer, Gazelle)
SMALL HERBIVORES:      2000 (Rabbit, Frog)
SCAVENGERS:            100  (Tied to predator activity)
BIRDS (General):       1000 (Songbird, Waterfowl - separate niche)
FISH:                  5000 (Base aquatic biomass)
```

**GAME IMPLICATIONS**:
- **Rabbits/Fish should be everywhere** (easy hunting, low yield)
- **Deer/Gazelle = sweet spot** (moderate difficulty, good yield)
- **Apex predators extremely rare** (legendary hunts)
- **Overhunting herbivores → predator population crash** (starvation)
- **Overhunting predators → herbivore explosion** (overgrazing)

## ECOLOGICAL GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### CURRENT GAPS IDENTIFIED:

1. **NO AQUATIC HERBIVORES**
   - Real ecosystems have fish that eat algae/plants
   - **Recommendation**: Add "Plant-Eating Fish" or just abstract this into generic "Fish"

2. **BIRD PREDATION UNDERREPRESENTED**
   - Raptors hunt more than just rabbits
   - **Recommendation**: Clarify Raptor → Songbird/Waterfowl predation

3. **INSECT LAYER MISSING**
   - You note insects as "density map" not entities
   - **Recommendation**: Keep abstracted but mention as food source for:
     - Frog, Giant Toad, Insectivore birds

4. **MARINE MAMMAL AMBIGUITY**
   - Is this seals (prey) or orca (predator)?
   - **Recommendation**: Split into:
     - "Seal" (Prey for Polar Bear, Shark)
     - "Orca" (Apex predator, hunts Fish/Seals)

5. **NO COMPETING HERBIVORES**
   - Different herbivores should compete for same graze space
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - Bison vs Gazelle (Savanna grassland)
     - Deer vs Caribou (Forest/Taiga transition)

6. **AMPHIBIOUS NICHE UNCLEAR**
   - Crocodile is water-edge specialist
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - Crocodile preys on Waterfowl, any animal drinking
     - Hippo? (Herbivore but dangerous - could add)

- **Predator Pack** (Wolf, Lion): High risk
- **Apex** (Polar Bear, Shark): Extreme risk
- **Ambush** (Crocodile): Extreme risk (no warning)

### SPECIAL MATERIALS (non-meat value)
- **Pelts**: Wolf, Lion, Bear, Fox (high value, warmth)
- **Ivory**: Elephant (rare, prestige)
- **Teeth/Claws**: All predators (weapons, ceremonial)
- **Feathers**: Raptor, Seabird (arrows, decoration)
- **Scales**: Crocodile, Snake (armor, mystical)

## ECOLOGICAL SIMULATION SUGGESTIONS

### POPULATION DYNAMICS
1. **Herbivore birth rate** > Predator birth rate (natural ratio)
2. **Predators starve** if prey population too low
3. **Herbivores overgraze** if predator population too low
4. **Seasons affect birth cycles** (spring = births, winter = die-offs)

### HUNTING PRESSURE
1. **Overhunting triggers migration** (prey leaves area)
2. **Successful hunts attract scavengers** (ecological signal)
3. **Apex predator hunting = reputation boost** (tribal prestige)
4. **Failed hunts = wounded animals** (dangerous, easier tracking)

### HABITAT CARRYING CAPACITY
Each biome supports different max populations:
- **Grassland/Savanna**: HIGH herbivore capacity (Bison, Gazelle)
- **Forest**: MEDIUM capacity (Deer, small predators)
- **Tundra/Snow**: LOW capacity (sparse, migratory herds)
- **Rainforest**: MEDIUM capacity (vertical niches, high diversity)
- **Desert**: LOW capacity (scarce water/food)
- **Aquatic**: VERY HIGH (fish biomass)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this structure** - any missing predator-prey links?
2. **Assign stat values** based on trophic position
3. **Population spawn rates** from biomass pyramid
4. **Resource drops** aligned with ecological logic
5. **Return to icon creation** with full ecological context

Let me know what needs adjustment before we proceed.
